3. Complete either **Option 1** or **Option 2**.


    - **Option 1**: If you are able to complete your certification before the homework due date, submit a screen shot that shows proof of completion.
     
     I filled to register at the Tenable University site. I watched the Tenable Training video but did not provide the Closed captioning or subtitles, unfortunately. 



    - I researched anf found only one coursera provide an accommodation.  
    - Here is Accommodation for learners with disabilities. [Accommodation](https://learners.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280056-Accommodations-for-learners-with-disabilities)

     Great, I did watch the Coursera video and worked on the subtitles video.

    - **Option 2**: You may be unable to complete your certification before the due date for a number of reasons, such as:
        - It takes longer than three hours to complete.
        - Completion requires several courses.
        - No formal certification is awarded. 

    If any of these are the case, complete three hours of training towards your selected certification and submit a one page summary that includes:
        - Certification title
        - Issuing organization
        - Description of certification
        - Why you are interested in this certification.
        - Summary of what was learned during your training.


### Submission Guidelines

- **Option 1**: Submit a screen shot that shows proof of completion.

-- I enrolled in Amazon Training, and I watched the name is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) about ten minutes. But the Amazon Training video does not accommodate Closed captioning or subtitles. So I watched a guy showed how to do hands-on on his windows screen. I received it and passed my Certificate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Fortunately, I remember doing hands-on on Azure Lab with SSH access to use Elastic Cloud. 

I received a cerification Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- **Option 2**: Submit a one page summary that includes:
    - Certification title - CEH, CISSP, and CCSP.
    - Issuing organization - 
      
      Cloud services provide enterprise organizations flexibility and new capabilities. 

    - Description of certification -  
     
     CCSP – Certified Cloud Security Professional - 
     CCSP shows you have the advanced technical skills and knowledge to design, manage and secure data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud using best practices, policies and procedures established by the cybersecurity experts at (ISC). 

    - Why you are interested in this certification. 
     I am interested in these CEH, CISSP, and CCSP certifications because one of my former employee suggested me to taking a Cyberseucirty and Cloud in few years ago. He told me he heard many companies need to hire the Cybersecurity CEH and Cloud Security Professional to demand a job. So I researched the Cloud still has issue vulnerabilities.
   
    
    - Summary of what was learned during your training.

I learned Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud almost the same Azure Lab Cloud what I learned how to create the machine server with HTTP and ssh to open ports, load balancer server and ssh key.  I see Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Azure Cloud are a bit different. 

- What is cloud computing?

--- The cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change

---The Cloud computing is 100 percent variable costs. Therefore a firm can eliminate the fixed costs and overhead of their own IT infrastructure or hardware.
